# Rust string-match

This is currently just a simple toy-project for porting some existing
fuzzy string matching algorithms from other languages into Rust. The
main goal here is to have fun and learn a little about Rust. However,
that is not to say that I don't think these utilities could be useful
and the plan is to move past a "toy" project into something that I
wouldn't mind sharing with the larger Rust community.
